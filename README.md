# AWS-EC2-autoscaling-files

Made this repo as personal notes for me when setting up autoscaling on AWS, it is based on a [qwiklabs quest](https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/10450?catalog_rank=%7B%22rank%22%3A1%2C%22num_filters%22%3A0%2C%22has_search%22%3Atrue%7D&parent=catalog&search_id=6312191)

Step 1: Create a configuration template that defines your EC2 instances. You can choose either the launch template or the launch configuration instructions, based on your preference.

Step 2: Create an Auto Scaling group to maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance becomes unhealthy.
